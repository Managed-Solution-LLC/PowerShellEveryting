## 📈 Report Analysis

### Finding Excessive Permissions
```powershell
# Import and analyze
$report = Import-Csv "MailboxPermissions_20251223_140000.csv"

# Find mailboxes with many Full Access delegates
$report | Where-Object { $_.'Full Access' -match ';.*;' } | 
    Select-Object 'Display Name', 'Full Access'

# Find users with access to multiple mailboxes
$report | Group-Object 'Full Access' | 
    Where-Object { $_.Count -gt 5 } | 
    Sort-Object Count -Descending
```

### Identify Forwarding Configurations
```powershell
$report = Import-Csv "MailboxPermissions_20251223_140000.csv"

# All forwarding configurations
$report | Where-Object { $_.'Forwarding Address' } | 
    Select-Object 'Display Name', 'Forwarding Address'
```

### Shared Mailbox Access Review
```powershell
$report = Import-Csv "MailboxPermissions_20251223_140000.csv"

# Shared mailboxes with multiple delegates
$report | Where-Object { $_.'Mailbox Type' -eq 'SharedMailbox' } |
    Where-Object { $_.'Full Access' } |
    Select-Object 'Display Name', 'Email', 'Full Access'
```

## ⚡ Performance

### Execution Times (Approximate)

| Mailbox Count | With Folder Permissions | Without Folder Permissions |
|---------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| 10 mailboxes | 30 seconds | 10 seconds |
| 50 mailboxes | 3-5 minutes | 1 minute |
| 100 mailboxes | 7-10 minutes | 2-3 minutes |
| 500 mailboxes | 40-60 minutes | 10-15 minutes |
| 1000+ mailboxes | 90+ minutes | 20-30 minutes |

### Performance Optimization

**For Large Environments:**
1. Disable folder permissions: `-IncludeFolderPermissions:$false`
2. Use targeted audits with `-UserPrincipalName` or `-CsvFilePath`
3. Filter by mailbox type: `-MailboxFilter SharedMailboxes`
4. Run during off-peak hours
5. Use dedicated admin workstation with stable connection

**Folder Permission Impact:**
- Processing time increases 3-5x when enabled
- Each mailbox requires 2 additional API calls (Inbox + Calendar)
- Network latency significantly impacts execution time

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Connection Timeout
**Symptom:** Connection drops during execution  
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Use shorter timeout, run in batches
$users = Get-EXOMailbox -ResultSize 100
$users | ForEach-Object { 
    .\Get-MailboxPermissionsReport.ps1 -UserPrincipalName $_.UserPrincipalName -CreateZip:$false
}
```

### Module Not Found
**Symptom:** ExchangeOnlineManagement module not installed  
**Solution:**
```powershell
Install-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement -Scope CurrentUser -Force
```

### Permission Denied
**Symptom:** Unable to retrieve mailbox permissions  
**Solution:** Verify admin role assignment:
```powershell
# Check current role assignments
Get-ManagementRoleAssignment -RoleAssignee your@email.com
```

### Slow Execution
**Symptom:** Script takes too long  
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Disable folder permissions
.\Get-MailboxPermissionsReport.ps1 -IncludeFolderPermissions:$false

# Or target specific mailboxes
.\Get-MailboxPermissionsReport.ps1 -MailboxFilter SharedMailboxes
```

### Display Names Not Resolving
**Symptom:** Shows GUIDs instead of names  
**Solution:**
- Ensure account has directory read permissions
- Some accounts may be external/deleted (expected)
- External users show as GUIDs (by design)

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Sensitive Data
Reports contain:
- ✅ Email addresses
- ✅ User names
- ✅ Access relationships
- ✅ Forwarding destinations

**Best Practices:**
1. Store reports securely (encrypted drives)
2. Limit report access to authorized personnel
3. Delete reports after analysis
4. Do not email unencrypted reports
5. Review data classification policies before sharing

### Audit Trail
- Script execution leaves no audit trail in mailbox logs
- Uses read-only operations
- No modifications made to mailboxes
- Consider logging script execution for compliance

5. Reassign shared mailbox access

### Compliance Review
**Goal:** Document access for auditors  
**Process:**
1. Run filtered audit: `.\Get-MailboxPermissionsReport.ps1 -MailboxFilter SharedMailboxes`

3. Review for compliance violations
4. Document approved delegations
5. Archive report for audit trail

### Shared Mailbox Cleanup
**Goal:** Optimize shared mailbox delegations  
**Process:**
1. Audit shared mailboxes: `.\Get-MailboxPermissionsReport.ps1 -MailboxFilter SharedMailboxes`
2. Identify mailboxes with excessive delegates
3. Remove inactive user permissions
4. Document business justification for remaining access
5. Schedule periodic re-audits

.\Get-MailboxPermissionsReport.ps1 -CreateZip:$false

# Get latest report
$latestReport = Get-ChildItem "MailboxPermissions_*.csv" | 
    Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending | 
    Select-Object -First 1

# Import and analyze
$permissions = Import-Csv $latestReport

# Custom analysis
$sharedMailboxes = $permissions | 
    Where-Object { $_.'Mailbox Type' -eq 'SharedMailbox' } |
    Where-Object { $_.'Full Access' }

Write-Host "Found $($sharedMailboxes.Count) shared mailboxes with delegated access"
